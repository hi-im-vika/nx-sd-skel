# nx-sd-skel
skeleton files for a new homebrew install

These scripts will automatically download the latest versions of certain files required to set up CFW on an SD card. They follows the steps outlined in [Rentry's guides](https://rentry.org/CFWGuides).

All scripts will copy into a folder called `sdcard-skel`. You can then copy the entire folder's contents into the root of your SD card.

To use these scripts, you'll need to create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to use Github's API.
